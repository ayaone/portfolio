      I'm a freelance web developer. I have been building websites and web apps since 2013 mainly for the education sector.    
    </p>
    <p>
      I provide an all in one package: hosting, design, back-end and front-end.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like working with VueJS and Laravel, but if you'd like your app to be developed using a different framework I am open to suggestions.
